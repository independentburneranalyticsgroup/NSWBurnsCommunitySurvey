# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it something like `nsw-burns-survey` or `burns-community-results`
3. Make it **public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
4. Don't initialize with README (we have our own files)

### Step 2: Upload Files
**Option A: Web Interface (Easiest)**
1. Download this entire folder to your computer
2. In your new GitHub repository, click "uploading an existing file"
3. Drag and drop all files from this folder
4. Commit with message: "Initial commit: NSW Burns Survey Interactive Results"

**Option B: Git Command Line**
```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/YOURREPONAME.git
cd YOURREPONAME

# Copy all files from this folder to your repository folder
# Then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: NSW Burns Survey Interactive Results"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. In your repository, go to **Settings** tab
2. Scroll down to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
3. Under "Source", select **"Deploy from a branch"**
4. Choose **"main"** branch and **"/ (root)"** folder
5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Access Your Site
- GitHub will provide a URL like: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`
- It may take 2-10 minutes for the site to become available
- Once live, the site will automatically update when you push changes

## File Structure

```
your-repo-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html              # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # Project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ DEPLOYMENT.md          # This file
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
```

## Customization Options

### Update Site Title/Description
Edit the `<title>` and `<meta>` tags in `index.html`:
```html
<title>Your Custom Title</title>
<meta name="description" content="Your custom description">
```

### Update Social Media URLs
Edit the Open Graph and Twitter meta tags in `index.html`:
```html
<meta property="og:url" content="https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/">
```

### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Add a `CNAME` file with your domain name
2. Configure DNS with your domain provider
3. Update GitHub Pages settings to use custom domain

### Analytics (Optional)
Add Google Analytics or other tracking code to `index.html` before `</head>`:
```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');
</script>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading
- Wait 10 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
- Check that repository is public
- Verify all files uploaded correctly
- Check GitHub Pages settings in repository Settings

### Broken Links/Assets
- Ensure all files are in the root directory
- Check that file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify `index.html` is in the root folder

### Updates Not Showing
- Changes can take 2-10 minutes to appear
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check that changes were committed and pushed

### Charts Not Loading
- Check that CDN links are accessible
- Verify Chart.js and datalabels plugin are loading
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## Performance Notes

- Site is optimized for fast loading
- Uses CDN resources for reliability
- Responsive design works on all devices
- Accessible design for neurodivergent users
- No build process required - pure HTML/CSS/JS

## Support
