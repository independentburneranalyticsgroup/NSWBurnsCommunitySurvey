I’m not interested in working with people who make decisions based on emotion rather than rationality. And I don’t want to have to manage difficult personalities in a volunteer role. It makes for too much stress in something that should be fun. Reduce the admin! It doesn’t need to be quite so admin heavy IMHO.

It’s a simple, cheap thing and the least that could be done to show appreciation and make people feel valued. ","With running my own theme camp, not too many. My theme camp runs very smoothly on the whole. Main issue is with crew ‘reverse gifting’ because they think they’re being helpful and contributing! I appreciate the grants - very helpful.  Had a minor concern about placement at Seed 2023 - site design could’ve been better thought through. (Ie not putting a family friendly camp next to an x-rated one!)  With other theme camps, I’ve had issues with poor management and leadership, lack of organization and people throwing tantrums and walking out, meaning I somehow end up being dumped with having to do everything. For example, three times I’ve had to be the one to pack down The Orphanage and get everything loaded onto trailers to get them offsite by gate closing times, including hauling rubbish and stuff left behind - both at Seed and Third Degree. Even though I’m not even a camp member! (Our theme camp often camps with them though.) Not going back for a fourth time though…  Gotta say though that it’s a HUGE effort to get everything out to Seed and costs a bomb in fuel etc. I’d much prefer to focus on more local events now that there are some. Not sure I’d make the trip out to Matong again - would have to be a very special event indeed to draw me back out there.","Yes! We collaborate with other camps all the time.

But I do think it would be worth considering having a communal storage unit for storing large, repeatable artworks/mutant vehicles and equipment.  I also liked the way the Kiwiburn art team had a shared library of tools for artists to ‘borrow’ onsite. And they offered a maker space onsite for artists and theme camps to create signage or repair costumes, decor etc.   I’d also be in favour personally of encouraging reuse, upcycling and using materials found in things like council cleanups for temporary art, especially things to be burned, rather than spending a fortune at Bunnings. And I’d also like to encourage reuse of art - current grants really only support creation of new art. But what about encouraging artists to bring back existing work or building on it? And helping to fund transport costs? Sustainability is just as important as leave no trace IMHO.    Shared transport options to get large scale art / mutant vehicles to site would also be a good thing to consider as well. Reduced carbon footprint. ",For what purpose?

Don’t let it become all about DJ’s, drugs and doof. At the heart, burns are an arts and counter culture movement. Let’s be that!! Because I think now, more than ever, our society needs this.

Given that there are additional expenses eg contributing to mine & other camps’ fundraisers, camp dues so we can provide alcohol / food for gifting, plus my own gifts & supplies, it adds up to be an expensive weekend, with minimum infrastructure / facilities / headline DJs provided as part of the ticket cost  Hoping y’all can find a middle ground between profitability & viability  Also, I think there is some residual burnout / frustration amongst the community about what happened with the previous leadership / Board of Directors. I’ve seen the comms on socials about drawing a line in the sand / moving forward under new leadership / letting it go, but I think maybe the level of burnout / disengagement caused has perhaps been underestimated. Other than the comments section, which tends to get toxic / passive aggressive (and subsequently shut down / dismissed) very quickly, I think that maybe more is needed to facilitate the community moving forward.  I think after COVID stopped play, then the leadership fiasco played out, then many camps conscientiously objected to the last Seed, then 2025 tix were so expensive (I didn’t buy one)… there have been many concurrent reasons for Burners to feel disengaged / disheartened and to turn their attention elsewhere.  That said. I’m not sure what the answer is; theme camp liaison? Actively creating a forum & holding space for people’s experience of the previous iteration?  We have a passionate, creative, articulate & enthusiastic community, whether or not the damage can be repaired and the event can be financially viable, remains to be seen.

I feel Seed needed ro not happen to garner the support.  A target for a big burn far enough ahead could motivate camps  and enable fundraisers to happen,The theme camp fundraisers was the glue - we need a big burn in the calendar to motivate and inspire established camps and new camps to get the gears in motion,2.0,-99,-99,-99,-99,450.0,350.0,300.0,150,I believe we need a central big burn to be the leading light and example of whats possible to inspire newbies.   Its great to see smaller burns happening but I think size is what creates the spectacle and breadth of experience plus the numbers to activate any one theme camp experience.   ,Love your work.

I know some folks get a kick out of this stuff but I actually think there were more volunteer roles than were necessary and folks time wasn’t really valued.,Better comms in burn coordination. Lots of very noisy chat groups with poorly structured comms so you have to wade through loads of messages between individuals broadcasting to everyone. We’ve also put work into expectation setting so folks understand the commitments of joining our camp.  ,"We put a lot of work into putting a filter on member recruitment, essentially creating a survey, vouching process and in some instances interviews to ensure the camp is safe (in terms of consent practice, respect etc). We also have had to create a mini not for profit entity to organise finances which has involved some extra admin but ultimately necessary. So yeah getting folks to do the boring bits like finances, AGMs etc has been a challenge at times but it’s been easy to get enthusiasm for builds, logistics, volunteering etc",We have mixed events eg traded Djs and venues.

I think the crux is climate change is narrowing our window for burns in Australia and we might need to evolve. I don’t need a burn at every burner festival I attend. I also think the lack of a large burner event is killing our momentum as the events aren’t big enough to recruit new burners out of our own bubbles. The core organizers are all getting older and that’s not a good sign of a thriving community (look at the church!).

Acknowledge that we are/were there and leave a positive trace. Tree/ grass planting, erosion control, weed control, ect ask local mob what the country needs.  3.
